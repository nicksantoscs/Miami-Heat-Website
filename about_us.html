        "The franchise began play in the 1988–89 NBA season as an expansion team. After a period of mediocrity, the Heat
        would gain relevance during the 1990s following the appointment of former head coach Pat Riley in the role of
        team president. Riley would construct the high-profile trades of Alonzo Mourning in 1995, and of Tim Hardaway in
        1996, which immediately propelled the team into playoff contention. Mourning and Hardaway would eventually lead
        the Heat to four division titles, prior to their departures in 2001 and 2002, respectively. As a result, the
        team struggled, and entered into a rebuild in time for the 2002–03 season. Led by Dwyane Wade, and following a
        trade for former NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) Shaquille O'Neal, Miami advanced to play in the NBA Finals in
        2006, where they clinched their first championship, led by Riley as head coach. After the departure of O'Neal
        two years later, the team entered into another period of decline for the remainder of the 2000s. This saw the
        resignation of Riley as head coach, who returned to his position as team president, and was replaced by Erik
        Spoelstra. In 2010, after creating significant cap space, the Heat partnered Wade with former league MVP LeBron
        James, and perennial NBA All-Star Chris Bosh, creating the "Big Three". During their four-year spell together,
        and under the guise of Spoelstra, James, Wade, and Bosh, they would lead the Heat to the NBA Finals in every
        season, and won two back-to-back championships in 2012 and 2013. The trio would all depart by 2016, and the team
        entered another period of rebuilding. Wade was eventually reacquired in 2018, albeit to retire with the
        franchise."

        "The American Airlines Arena (AAA) is a sports and entertainment arena located in Downtown Miami, Florida,
        along Biscayne Bay. It was constructed beginning in 1998 as a replacement for the Miami Arena and designed
        the architecture firms Arquitectonica and 360 Architecture. The Arena is home to the Miami Heat of the
        National Basketball Association."
