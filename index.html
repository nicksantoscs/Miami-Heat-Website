        to remain competitive
        well into the future. After landing a star in free agency with Butler and surrounding him with quality talent
        like Herro in the draft,
        the Heat are on their way to being a factor in the Eastern Conference."

        "Dwyane Wade went out in style and in front of some of his best friends.
        <br>The retiring Miami Heat star notched a triple-double in his final career game Wednesday night against the
        Brooklyn
        Nets. And he did it with LeBron James, Chris Paul and Carmelo Anthony watching from courtside seats.
        <br>Wade secured his fifth career triple-double in the closing minute of the third quarter when he drove and
        fittingly
        kicked to Udonis Haslem for a jumper from the top of the free-throw circle and his 10th assist. Wade and Haslem
        both
        came into the NBA with the Heat in 2003 and have been teammates in 15 of their 16 seasons."
